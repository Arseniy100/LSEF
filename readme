LSEF: the locally stationary convolutional ensemble filter

This repo contains Python and R code that allows one to carry out numerical experiments with the 
locally stationary convolutional ensemble filter (LSEF).
 
The LSEF is proposed and described in the paper 
“A locally stationary convolutional ensemble filter” by 
Michael Tsyrulnikov and Arseniy Sotskiy 
ArXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14318.pdf 

With the code in the repo, one can reproduce results reported in the paper.

In the paper, we propose a new kind of ensemble filter in which prior covariances are regularized 
with a spatial model on the sphere. The model termed the Locally Stationary Convolution Model 
is a constrained version of the general Gausssian process convolution model. 
The spatially variable convolution kernel of the model is estimated online using the prior ensemble. 
Local stationarity means that the convolution kernel slowly changes in space as compared to its length scale. 
The model is estimated online in a two-stage procedure. 
First, ensemble perturbations are bandpass filtered in several wavenumber bands to extract aggregated local spatial spectra. 
Second, a neural network recovers the local spectra from sample variances of the filtered fields. 
The estimated local spectra are converted to the spatially variable convolution kernel, 
from which a square root of the model prior covariance matrix is computed and used in the analysis. 

The new  filter is successfully tested in numerical experiments with a static toy model on the sphere 
(see folder Sphere in the repo) and in cyclic filtering on the circle (see folder Circle in the repo).
